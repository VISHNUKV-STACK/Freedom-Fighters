                        Freedom fighters made sacrifices which one cannot even imagine of doing for their loved ones, leave
                        alone the
                        country.
                        The amount of pain, hardships, and opposite they have endured cannot be put into words. The generations
                        after them will
                        always be indebted to them for their selfless sacrifices and hard work. <br><br>
        
                        One cannot emphasize enough on the importance of freedom fighters. After all, they are the ones because
                        of
                        whom
                        we
                        celebrate Independence Day. No matter how small a role they played, they are very much significant today
                        as
                        they
                        were in
                        those times. Moreover, they revolted against the colonizers so as to stand up for the country and its
                        people. <br><br>
        
        
                        Furthermore, most of the freedom fighters even went to war to safeguard the freedom of their people. It
                        did
                        not matter
                        that they had no training; they did it for the pure intention of making their country free. Most of the
                        freedom fighters
                        sacrificed their lives in the war for independence. <br><br>
                        Most importantly, freedom fighters inspired and motivated others to fight injustice. They are the
                        pillars
                        behind the
                        freedom movement. They made people aware of their rights and their power. It is all because of the
                        freedom
                        fighters that
                        we prospered into a free country free from any kind of colonizers or injustice.
